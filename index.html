<h3><b> wild animals....</b></h2>
<p>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include 
all plants, fungi, and other organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced 
by humans.[1]Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands 
and other areas including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms.</p>
